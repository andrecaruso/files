Mechanics|Description|Score
Action Points|Control what the user may do during their turn in the game by allocating them a budget of ‘action points’. Actions points allow users’ time to think of their next and future moves, the game gets the user into a strategic mindset when playing.|0
Appointment|A mechanic in which to succeed a “player” must return at a predefined time to take a predetermined action. Simple and powerful mechanic to influence the player’s behavior.|0
Behavioral Momentum|Used to give confidence and motivate players to continue the game.|0
Capture-Eliminate|The strength of the player is defined by how many points or counters the player has captured. This is most prominent in action, strategic or war based games. Many board games also use this technique.|0
Cascading Information, Cut Scene, Story|Information released in minimal snippets to gain the appropriate level of understanding at each point during a game.|0
Collecting|Elements of virtual knowledge, competencies, or rewards can be represented by virtual objects, which can be collected by the player.|0
Communal Discovery|Involves an entire community working together to solve a problem. Has an incredible opportunity to positively influence the games’ usage and acceptance. Essentially crowd sourcing with communal incentives to rapidly create a large, self-propagating network.|0
Cooperation-Collaboration|In cooperative games, the mechanics require players to work with one another but their goals are different, and not all players are guaranteed to benefit equally. In collaborative games, players share common goals and outcomes; players either win or lose together. Cooperative games exist on the spectrum between competitive and collaborative games, where gamers are rewarded for group-oriented strategies only when it is in their own self-interest.|0
Game Turns|A segment of the game set aside for certain actions to happen before moving on to the next turn, where the sequence of events can largely be repeated.|0
Infinite Gameplay|Games that have no explicit end. Most applicable to casual games that can refresh their content or games where a static (but positive) state is a reward of its own.|0
Meta-Game Mechanic|Rewards or improvements that can be earned during the actual game-play and/or outside of it, that carries over to repeat plays.|0
Ownership (GM)|Used to create loyalty of the gaming pool.|0
Pareto Optimal|A mechanic where the outcome is one in which no player could be better off without another becoming worse off. The mechanic occurs in a number of conflicts, negotiation, economics, management and quantum games. Pareto efficiency is reached if the games’ outcome is shown to deliver a Pareto optimal allocation of resources.|0
Pavlovian Interaction|Follows the methodology ‘easy to learn, hard to master’. Meaning the game is simple to pick up and play, however, increases its difficulty as the user advances through the game. Used to ‘hook’ gamers due to its replay value and challenging environment.|0
Protégé Effect|Explores learners’ tendency to work harder for their teachable agents (i.e. their avatars or alter ego) than for themselves; it has significant benefits for learning and engagement.|0
Questions and Answers|Used within the gaming environment as a basic, yet effective means of interacting and engaging with the player to facilitate learning.|0
Quick Feedback|Shows the user what they have just done, and gives them instant gratification (the feel-good factor) of things happening after they have completed a task. Allows the user to feel understood by the game; by giving a user power, the game fulfills a natural human desire.|0
Resource Management|Establishing relative values for different types of resources. Games that use this mechanic often have several concurrent transactions and the challenge involves making the best decision given the resources and time constraints.|0
Rewards|Feedback a player would receive for a worthy action. Used to incentivise the player to progress in the game. Rewards are designed to sustain engagement and to satisfy the player.|0
Role Playing|Rely on mechanics to establish the effectiveness of actions within the game, depending on how well the player assumes and develops their role as a virtual character.|0
Status|Provides a sense of belonging or meaningful empowerment. Multiple forms of status, such as titles, levels, tiers, rank not just globally but also locally within a community.|0
Tile Based and Physical Movement|Based on how players or elements in games move from one point to another. Tile based movement allows players to move and explore a world which is divided into tiles in turns and amount of tiles moved. Physics based movement provides a greater sense of immersion as players feel as though they are inside the game environment. The focus is no longer about the game tiles but on what players do with them within the limited resources and time.|0
Tile-Laying|Often drawn by the player for strategic positioning in order to achieve a set personal objective or game based goal.|0
Tokens to Act as Cards or Random Elements|To add the element of surprise and act as a randomiser, cards and tokens can be used to add a layer of unpredictability to the game and determine game states.|0
Urgent Optimism|Used to elicit a desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle combined with the belief that it has a reasonable hope of success.|0
Virality|Mechanics to grow player base which if done right should enrich gameplay. Also designed to reinforce retention.|0
