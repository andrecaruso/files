Decomposition|When we treat decomposition we are also treating a bunch of other concepts and phenomena around the process itself, of breaking the problem down; Everything involved follows a “jigsaw puzzle thinking”, it is all about parts and wholes; The contrast between wholes and parts is highlighted in this line. Decomposition may lead to recursion when the parts are similar in nature to the whole. Decomposition: how a full picture can be fragmented into pieces / how to breaks down wholes into parts; Composition: how to assemble them all into one; Composition assemble parts into wholes; Integration: how to put a new piece into the current puzzle; New parts may be integrated into existing wholes; Interface: how their shapes fit each other; A part that is responsible for interacting with the external environment is an interface. Interrelationship: what each piece form with the adjacent ones;  Parts establish several relations with each other within the system, which should be accounted when decomposing/composing; Emergence: what can be seen in the full picture but not in each piece; composition may lead to emergence, when the whole has a feature/behavior none of the parts have. Reuse: which pieces may be repeated over other regions of the puzzle; The reuse of parts usually makes the decomposition worth.Topics: (Languages) Scansion and poem structural analysis; (Math) Factoring (Computer Science) API; (Chemistry) Separation processes; (Biology) Animal and plant anatomy; (Biology) Interspecific interactions;  (Biology) Ecology.
