Mechanics|Description|Tax|codig
Action Points|Control what the user may do during their turn in the game by allocating them a budget of ‘action points’. Actions points allow users’ time to think of their next and future moves, the game gets the user into a strategic mindset when playing. # Action Point mechanic, each player has a certain amount of points per round. These points can be spent on available actions, until the player does not have enough remaining to purchase any more actions. Many games limit the player to one action, which is a very simple form of this mechanic. This mechanic derives from the BGG mechanic Action Point Allowance System we rephrase its description[1] and adapt the name to the concept. In Takenoko, for example, players have 2 action points to choose among different possible actions. {kritza}|Evaluating|GM21
Appointment|A mechanic in which to succeed a “player” must return at a predefined time to take a predetermined action. Simple and powerful mechanic to influence the player’s behavior. # The purpose of appointment mechanics is to make playing the game into a habit, a routine part of your day. Remember that a free to play game lives or dies based on its ability to retain paying players, and a player is really only likely to become a paying player if they stick with the game for longer periods of time. It’s impossible to emphasize this enough. Retention, retention, retention. This isn’t limited to free to play games, either. If you’ve ever played an MMORPG, you’ve probably seen daily quests. Games with a focus on multiplayer or social elements may also have these, such as Animal Crossing’s fruit, Pokemon’s berry plants, and Nintendogs’ contests. {chen2014a}|Understanding|GM51
Behavioral Momentum|Used to give confidence and motivate players to continue the game. # Definition: The tendency of players to keep doing what they have been doing. Example: From Jesse Schell’s awesome Dice talk: “I have spent ten hours playing Farmville. I am a smart person and wouldn’t spend 10 hours on something unless it was useful. Therefore this must be useful, so I can keep doing it.” {schonfeld2010} # Behavioral momentum is used in games to make players keep on doing what they have been doing. In many games you will normally have a skill level what you can level up by repeating the process of something. For example in WoW You can level a skill called mining by repeating the process {anderson2015}|Retention|GM64
Capture-Eliminate|The strength of the player is defined by how many points or counters the player has captured. This is most prominent in action, strategic or war based games. Many board games also use this technique. # This mechanics is commonly used in action, strategic or war based games as well as in many board games where the strength of players is determined by obtaining points or capturing counters[8]. This mechanics is usually tied to a strategy and planning context in which the player has to make up a strategy in order to win. This is why it could be viewed as a problem solving mechanic related to Problem-based learning. It could also be related to behaviorism if the fact of obtaining points, and capturing or eliminating counters represents a reward of players’ actions. {patino2016}|Applying|GM41
Cascading Information, Cut Scene, Story|Information released in minimal snippets to gain the appropriate level of understanding at each point during a game. # The theory is that information ought to be discharged in the minimum possible snippets to achieve the appropriate level of understanding at every point throughout a game narrative. showing basic actions 1st, unlocking more as you progress through levels. This is so you can handle the information better than if you was given too much information to remember in a short period of time. In World of Warcraft you get a talent tree which unlocks more spells and abilities as you level up. This is so its easy for you to learn only a few at the beginning but as you slowly level up you are learning more spells until you reach a the max level and have unlocked the full talent tree allowing you access to all of the spells. If you was given all of the spells at the beginning  of the game it would be chaotic and you would not know what to do. {anderson2015}|Retention|GM52
Collecting|Elements of virtual knowledge, competencies, or rewards can be represented by virtual objects, which can be collected by the player. # game where players need to collect something, a component, points, resources etc. Pool Building With this mechanic players start the game with a predetermined pool of components and add or remove components to this pool throughout the game. Players use the components of this pool in other aspects of the game, they can be used as resources to fuel other actions or as a scoring. This mechanic derives from the Deck/Poll Building BGG mechanic which mix two mechanics, which we split in Pool Building and Deck Building. Deck building is a composition of Poll Building and Card mechanics. As example, in Quarriors you build a pool of dices which you roll each round to battle and try to get points, in Dominion you build a deck of cards from which cards you use to colect more cards and to score points. Set Collection In this type of Collection, what players collect need to be part of a pre-defined set, in order to complete their objective in collecting. The main idea is that players collect the sets by collecting the parts of the set. Pit is a game where players must collect all cards of the same type. {xexeo2017}|Applying|GM46
Communal Discovery|Involves an entire community working together to solve a problem. Has an incredible opportunity to positively influence the games’ usage and acceptance. Essentially crowd sourcing with communal incentives to rapidly create a large, self-propagating network. The game dynamic wherein an entire community is rallied to work together to solve a riddle, a problem or a challenge. Immensely viral and very fun.Example: DARPA balloon challenge, the cottage industries that appear around McDonalds monopoly to find ''Boardwalk'' {schonfeld2010}|Evaluating|GM24
Competition|Competition could mean a player against the other players, or a team of players cooperating/collaborating together to compete against other teams. In this second case, competition could be associated to collaborative learning. We consider competition as a different game mechanics from collaboration or cooperation since collaborative and cooperative games do not necessarily imply competition {patino2016}|Evaluating|GM42
Cooperation-Collaboration|In cooperative games, the mechanics require players to work with one another but their goals are different, and not all players are guaranteed to benefit equally. In collaborative games, players share common goals and outcomes; players either win or lose together. Cooperative games exist on the spectrum between competitive and collaborative games, where gamers are rewarded for group-oriented strategies only when it is in their own self-interest. # Cooperation: Independent goals with agreements not to interfere with each other. Collaboration The process of shared creation; collectively creating something new that could not have been created by the individual users. {michaelmacfadden2018}|Applying|GM43
Design-editing|We define this game mechanics as the possibility for the player to edit objects, scenes or other game components; or adding new components to the game. Since editing is about modifying and constructing into the game world, we see a relation with the constructionism learning theory. {patino2016}|Applying|GM11
Game Turns|A segment of the game set aside for certain actions to happen before moving on to the next turn, where the sequence of events can largely be repeated. # A game turn is an important fundamental concept to almost all non-computer games, and many video games as well (although in video games, various real-time genres have become much more popular). In general, a turn is a segment of the game set aside for certain actions to happen before moving on to the next turn, where the sequence of events can largely repeat. In a truly abstract game (backgammon) turns are nothing more than a means to regulate play. In less abstract games (Risk), turns obviously denote the passage of time, but the amount of time is not clear, nor important. Insimulation games, time is generally more concrete. Wargames usually specify the amount of time each turn represents, and in sports games a turn is usually distinctly one ‘play’, although the amount of time a play takes can vary. {anderson2010}|Evaluating|GM26
Infinite Gameplay|Games that have no explicit end. Most applicable to casual games that can refresh their content or games where a static (but positive) state is a reward of its own. # Infinite gameplay is the act of the game never ending until the player loses. As the game progresses further, it will become harder for the player to keep up. {samuelm96}|Creating|GM12
Meta-Game Mechanic|Rewards or improvements that can be earned during the actual game-play and/or outside of it, that carries over to repeat plays. # Definition: a game which exists layered within another game. These generally are discovered rather than explained (lest they cause confusion) and tend to appeal to ~2% of the total gameplaying audience. They are dangerous as they can induce confusion (if made too overt) but are powerful as they’re greatly satisfying to those who find them. Example: hidden questions / achievements within world of warcraft that require you to do special (and hard to discover) activities as you go through other quests {schonfeld2010}|Analysing|GM32
Movement|This game mechanics refers to how players move from one point to another in a game. Movement could be considered a type of discovery learning in game contexts that integrate a game environment with learning experiences or information to be discovered. {patino2016} # Movement This mechanic happens when components move around the play area during the game, this movement may be dictated by rules or chosen by players. Point-To-Point Movement With this mechanic the components that move have specific spaces it can occupy, those spaces has some indication of connection between them and movement is only allowed from a space to a connected one. Also the pieces can never be in the middle or between two different spaces, it need to be in a single space at any time. This BGG mechanic description[1] tries to distinguish it from similar BGG mechanics, but in doing so it fails to grasp the concept of it and miss the similarity it need to have with those other mechanics. Area Movement This mechanic happens when the spaces in Point-to-Point Movement are Areas, and their connection is determined by their adjacency and possibly other artificial connections. We do not follow the BGG description that asks for areas of varying size[1]. {xexeo2017}|Analysing|GM44
Ownership (GM)|Used to create loyalty of the gaming pool. The term game pool, or gaming pool, belongs to the discipline of gamification and refers to the model where user rewards can be shared with other team members in order to improve team commitment. # Definition: The act of controlling something, having it be your property. Example: Ownership is interesting on a number of levels, from taking over places, to controlling a slot, to simply owning popularity by having a digital representation of many friends. {schonfeld2010}|Creating|GM13
Pareto Optimal|A mechanic where the outcome is one in which no player could be better off without another becoming worse off. The mechanic occurs in a number of conflicts, negotiation, economics, management and quantum games. Pareto efficiency is reached if the games’ outcome is shown to deliver a Pareto optimal allocation of resources.|Evaluating|GM27
Pavlovian Interaction|Follows the methodology ‘easy to learn, hard to master’. Meaning the game is simple to pick up and play, however, increases its difficulty as the user advances through the game. Used to ‘hook’ gamers due to its replay value and challenging environment. # Atari founder Nolan Bushnell made a claim way back in the '70s that a game should be [easy to learn but difficult to master]), and this is a pretty perfect recipe for making titles that are continuously engaging.{prince2020}|Retention|GM65
Protégé Effect|Explores learners’ tendency to work harder for their teachable agents (i.e. their avatars or alter ego) than for themselves; it has significant benefits for learning and engagement. # This game mechanics is based on the idea that teaching something to someone else improves learning. In game contexts where players can teach something to other players, this mechanic could be related to Cognitive Apprenticeship since one of the players could take the role of master of a skill that teaches that skill to another player in the role of an apprentice. {patino2016}|Creating|GM14
Questions and Answers|Used within the gaming environment as a basic, yet effective means of interacting and engaging with the player to facilitate learning.|Understanding|GM53
Quick Feedback|Shows the user what they have just done, and gives them instant gratification (the feel-good factor) of things happening after they have completed a task. Allows the user to feel understood by the game; by giving a user power, the game fulfills a natural human desire.|Analysing|GM31
Resource Management|Establishing relative values for different types of resources. Games that use this mechanic often have several concurrent transactions and the challenge involves making the best decision given the resources and time constraints. # Resource management mechanics permit to establish values for different resources in a game. ''Games that use this mechanic often have several concurrent transactions and the challenge involves making the best decision given the resources and time constraint''. As making the best decisions could involve problem solving, we believe this mechanic is, in some game contexts, related to problem-based learning. It could also be associated to Self-regulated learning. Similar mechanics: Goods/Information and Action Points. {patino2016} # Besides representing data, resources are a kind of game element that is directly linked to game goals. So, the player has to manage these elements ''in pursuit of your goal'' [4]. Figure 7 presents the ontology branch of this concept {xexeo2017}|Evaluating|GM25
Rewards|Feedback a player would receive for a worthy action. Used to incentivise the player to progress in the game. Rewards are designed to sustain engagement and to satisfy the player.|Evaluating|GM28
Role Playing|Rely on mechanics to establish the effectiveness of actions within the game, depending on how well the player assumes and develops their role as a virtual character. # With this mechanic players need to interpret characters during the game. They should then act, speak, behave as their character, which can be designated, chosen or created, and not necessarily be the same throughout the game. The BGG mechanic with the same name has a unexpected and confusing description[1]. It is unexpected as it’s inspiration, tabletop Role Playing Games, are mainly about players taking the role of a character in a story and in the description it is only mentioned as a possibility. The confusion happens as it only states possibilities and those possibilities are very different ones, which could easily happen separately in a game. A good example is Captain Sonar, where players interpret different members of a submarine crew {xexeo2017}|Understanding|GM54
Status|Provides a sense of belonging or meaningful empowerment. Multiple forms of status, such as titles, levels, tiers, rank not just globally but also locally within a community. # Definition: The rank or level of a player. Players are often motivated by trying to reach a higher level or status. Example: white paladin level 20 in WOW. {schonfeld2010}|Creating|GM15
Tile Based and Physical Movement|Based on how players or elements in games move from one point to another. Tile based movement allows players to move and explore a world which is divided into tiles in turns and amount of tiles moved. Physics based movement provides a greater sense of immersion as players feel as though they are inside the game environment. The focus is no longer about the game tiles but on what players do with them within the limited resources and time. # Grid Movement This is the mechanic when the areas of Area Movement are polygons of the same type and size, normally squares or hexagons. Connection is defined through sharing edges and sometimes by sharing vertex. Creating then a Grid structure for movement on the game. The original BGG description[1] although not wrong, lacks information. An natural example is Chess {xexeo2017}|Applying|GM
Tile-Laying|Often drawn by the player for strategic positioning in order to achieve a set personal objective or game based goal. # in a Tile Laying game, the 'board' is often created by the players as they play the game. These tiles are typically drawn from a communal bag or other area and the player laying it on the 'board' also takes an action based on the tile laid. These tiles have rules of placement, and can almost often be placed in many different places on the 'board.' This makes the decision of where/how to lay the tile the key decision of the game. Sometimes the tile placement is secondary to how/when the associated action is taken and how that effects the other point/victory conditions. {ford2022}|Creating|GM17
Tokens to Act as Cards or Random Elements|To add the element of surprise and act as a randomiser, cards and tokens can be used to add a layer of unpredictability to the game and determine game states. # This mechanic is any component the player may manipulate directly[4, 5]. Mentioned many times in descriptions of the BGG list as pawns. Tile This is the mechanic for using tiles as a component. Although not mandatory many games use this concept as a main feature in the game, with all gameplay involving the tiles. Carcassone use tiles to dynamically build the board. Card This is the mechanic for using cards in the game. This is a very basic concept, but cards are a versatile component and have great expression within the game. Cards are used in many ways in games, going far beyond traditional card games, such as random event generator, power-ups, limited resources, etc. They can be found in many games, varying from Poker to Settlers of Catan {xexeo2017}|Retention|GM62
Urgent Optimism|Used to elicit a desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle combined with the belief that it has a reasonable hope of success. # Definition: Extreme self motivation. The desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success. Example: From Jane McGonical’s TED talk. The idea that in proper games an “epic win” or just “win” is possible and therefore always worth acting for. {schonfeld2010}|Evaluating|GM29
Virality|Mechanics to grow player base which if done right should enrich gameplay. Also designed to reinforce retention.|Retention|GM63
