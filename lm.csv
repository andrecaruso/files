LM|Description|Taxonomia|codig
Accountability|Can be viewed as autonomy where learners take responsibility for and control of themselves and their learning, including being less spoon-fed. May also include elements of learners taking responsibility for determining and directing the content of their learning. Related with open learning mechanics.|Creating|LM
Action-Task|An approach to learning involving individuals working on real projects, possibly with group support (collaborative/cooperative learning) to assist members reflect on their experience and to plan next actions. # This mechanics could be associated with a quest system that invites the player to perform a specific task in order to get a reward. Since the task is a concrete action it could be related to Problem based learning or Task-based learning and Body/mind processing. Also, since some of those tasks require the player to collaborate together, it could also be related to Collaborative learning. {patino2016}|Applying|LM
Analyse|Related to diagnostic tests to identify weaknesses, and used so that these might be addressed in a more focused manner.|Analysing|LM
Assessment|Measurement of the progress and achievement of a learner (typically through quizzes, examinations or even projects). For example, formative assessment allows learners to gauge their proficiency thereby to improve their self-regulatory skills. Rather than expressed as marks or grades, words are used to convey or reveal information, which can then be used diagnostically (e.g. summative assessment).|Evaluating|LM
Competition|Competitive learning is often used as an extracurricular activity to develop creativity and problem solving skills. Game theory offers techniques for formulating competition between parties that wish to reach an optimal position.|Applying|LM
Demonstration|A pedagogical method related to problem-based learning.|Appying|LM
Discover|An inquiry-based learning mechanic (from constructivist learning theory) where the learner draws on past experiences and existing knowledge to discover new facts and relationships to solve problems. As a result, learners are more likely to retain concepts and knowledge in contrast to transmissionist learning. Related to: guided discovery, problem-based learning, simulation-based learning, case-based learning, and incidental learning.|Retention|LM
Experimentation|Typically involves laboratory/practical classes, this type of teaching is often used in curricula in experimental sciences, biomedical and engineering disciplines, which is broadly intended to offer training in techniques and learning how to carry out experimental investigations. Associated to experiential learning.|Analysing|LM
Explore|A mechanism that encourages the learner to explore and experiment to uncover relationships, with much less of a focus on didactic training (teaching students by lecturing them). Exploratory learning approaches are considered most appropriate for teaching generalised thinking and problemsolving skills, and may not be the best approach for such things as memorisation (or repetition). Is related to constructivist theory.|Retention|LM
Feedback|Oral or written developmental advice on performance so that the learner has a better understanding of values, standards, criteria, etc. Linked with formative assessment.|Analysing|LM
Generalisation-Discrimination|In psychology this relates to the process by which people learn to make different responses to different stimuli. Behaviourists describe this as classical conditioning (also Pavlovian or respondent conditioning, Pavlovian reinforcement). In some ways this can be viewed as induction. Induction (inductive learning/teaching) aims at equipping learners with background information so that they might become effective in their role sooner.|Retention|LM
Guidance|A means to help students see the structure, links and direction of the course material.|Retention|LM
Hypothesis|Often related to acquisition-learning it is a method to develop competency in a specific subject area. Most contemporary use in education relates to performing a task and being able to debate the underpinning knowledge and understanding.|Evaluating|LM
Identify|A social learning theory (or cognitive theory) that posits learning will most likely occur if there is a close identification between the observer and the model and if the observer also has a good deal of self-efficacy.|Analysing|LM
Imitation|This is similar to role-play where a planned learning activity requires participants to take on the role of individuals representing different perspectives (e.g. mock interview) to meet specific learning objectives, such as to promote empathy or to expose participants to a scenario in which they will have to take part in the future #This mechanics could be related to Cognitive apprenticeship where a moreknowledgeable other is imitated by the player. It can also be related to Social Learning theory since it implies modelling, observation and imitation. {patino2016}|Applying|LM
Incentive|Incentive learning is the process via which learners update changes in the value of rewards. Such methods are useful in changing the behaviour of the learner, where a stimulus-response habit mechanism and a goaldirected process are the two learning mechanisms. The first is learning about the instrumental contingency between the response and reward, whereas the second consists of the acquisition of incentive value by the reward.|Evaluating|LM
Instructional|Where a facilitator or teacher provides learner support within a framework determined by the course leader. Specific learning objectives are followed through sequentially. A generic instructional model such as ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation) can be used. # It is based on the process “where a facilitator or teacher provides learner support within a framework determined by the course leader. Specific learning objectives are followed through sequentially”. This mechanic could be associated to Direct instruction and programmed instruction. {patino2016}|Retention|LM
Modelling|A means to test a hypothesis, to evaluate a concept or as a form of observational learning.|Creating|LM
Motivation|In terms of extrinsic motivation, marks and grades are used to target students who are more concerned with the numeric value of their work, and those that seek status. Intrinsic motivation typifies students who enjoy challenge, want to master a subject, are curious and want to learn. They are inspired to achieve high grades even when the task does not inspire interest.|Evaluating|LM
Objectify|Termed behavioural objectives (commonly referred as learning outcomes). Its meaning ranges from exact, measurable outcomes of specific learning experiences to more generalised statements for courses of study.|Understanding|LM
Observation|Observational learning (also referred to vicarious learning, social learning, modelling) is based on the concept that learning occurs as a function of watching, retaining and replicating the behaviour of others. # This learning mechanic is based on the idea that learning occurs as a function of watching, retaining and replicating the behaviour of others [8]. Therefore, this mechanic could be associated to the Social learning theory and Modelling {patino2016}|Analysing|LM
Ownership (LM)|Associated to constructivist theory where knowledge is internalised by learners through processes of accommodation and assimilation, they construct new knowledge from their experiences.|Creating|LM
Participation|A (active learning) process of engaging with the learning task at both the cognitive and affective level.|Understanding|LM
Plan|A conditional no-regret learning mechanic associated to Bayesian learning and hypothesis testing. As with a given type of game and a given amount of information, there may exist no learning procedure that satisfies certain reasonable criteria of performance and convergence. The learner has to strategically manage his or her resources to achieve an aggregate learning outcome. # A learning mechanic associated to hypothesis testing that can be be used to support Problem-based learning in game contexts where the player has to make up a strategy in order to solve a problem. {patino2016}|Creating|-
Question and Answer|An active learning mechanism linked with participation that encourages learners to use the questioning strategies to assess what they have learned, to develop their thinking skills.|Understanding|LM
Reflect-Discuss|Consideration of an experience, or of learning, to enhance understanding or inform action. Learners often compile logbooks to record their reflections on learning activities.|Evaluating|LM
Repetition|A method that uses traditional curriculum for students to practice at home or onsite. Although significant practice is performed, higher order learning is not involved.|Retention|LM
Responsibility|Often related to self-directed learning where the learner has control over educational decisions, including goals, resources, methods and criteria for judging success. Often used as a learning situation where the learner has some influence on some of the learning aspects.|Creating|LM
Shadowing|Often used in medical sciences where the student shadows their mentor during general practice or in operating theatres. Shadowing is also a form of learning through apprenticeships. Associated with experiential learning.|Analysing|LM
Simulation|Often associated with role-play it is increasingly used with ICTbased learning activities for decision-making to simulate cause and effect. # When this mechanic implies role-play interactions, it is considered by some authors as one type of a learning strategy within the experiential learning approach. When simulation includes also a “cause and effect” principle in decision-making, it could be also related to behaviorism and programmed instruction. {patino216}|Applying|LM
Tutorial|Used with different meanings according to discipline, type of institution, level, and teaching and learning method that involves a tutor or peer.|Understanding|LM
