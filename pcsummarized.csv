Abstraction|Abstraction is a thought process, usually carrying information from a context to another, producing a contrast (particular-general, concrete-abstract, complex-simple) As reinforced by its etymology, it brings the idea of drawing, borrowing, capturing something, but not a real object . In CT literature, this is directed towards capturing the essentials, leaving behind unnecessary details.|0
Algorithm|Algorithms are made of a finite collection of unambiguous steps organized by flow of control structures, such as sequences, loops and conditionals . Algorithm line is illustrated on Figure 5, showing the concepts involved using a flowchart of a parallel algorithm as example . For the execution of an algorithm, it is necessary to consider what will execute it, the underlying computational model.|0
Automation|Automation occurs when something becomes automatic to you, independent of your guidance . Instructing machines lead us to the creation of artifacts (software development and hardware tinkering), enables scaling projects and powers simulations . Automation freed them and us from the torment of being constantly annoyed by questions about what to do.|0
Data|Data is essentially encoded by structures to define how its units and their combinations are mapped into respective meanings and how they can be managed or transformed . Data structures commonly refer to stacks, graphs, charts, tables and classes . So, information must first be gathered/collected, then represented through data structures, to then be transformed, visualized, interpreted and analyzed.|0
Decomposition|Decomposition breaks down wholes into parts . Composition assemble parts into wholes . New parts may be integrated into existing wholes . The reuse of parts usually makes the decomposition worth. Everything involved follows a ‘jigsaw puzzle thinking’, it is all about parts and wholes .|0
Evaluation|The evaluation line is illustrated on Figure 8, showing the concepts involved . Evaluation is done through a detailed examination, an analysis . It might judge a property, such as efficiency and correctness, or lead to building up predictions . The examination also may lead to reorganization tasks such as classification, clustering and sorting.|0
