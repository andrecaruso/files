Mechanics|Description
Recall| RECOGNIZING: Identifying. RECALLING Retrieving DEFINITIONS AND EXAMPLES Locating knowledge in long-term memory that is consistent with presented material (e.g., Recognize the dates of important events in U.S. history) Retrieving relevant knowledge from long-term memory (e.g., Recall the dates of important events in U.S. history).
Understand| Construct meaning from instructional messages, including oral, written and graphic communication. Interpreting: Clarifying, paraphrasing, representing, translating; Changing from one fonn of representation {e.g., numerical) to another (e.g., verbal) (e.g., Paraphrase important speeches and documents).  EXEMPLIFYING: illustrating, instantiating; Finding a specific example or illustration of a concept or principle (e.g., Give examples of various artistic painting styles).  CLASSIFYING: Categorizing, subsuming; Determining that something belongs to a category {e.g., Classify observed or described cases of mental disorders).  SUMMARIZING: Abstracting, generalizing; Abstracting a general theme or major point(s) {e.g. Write a short summary of the event portrayed on a videotape). INFERRING: Concluding, extrapolating, interpolating, predicting; Drawing a logical conclusion from presented information (e.g., ln learning a foreign language, infer grammatical principles from examples). COMPARING: Contrasting, mapping, matching; Detecting correspondences between two ideas, objects, and the like (e.g., Compare historical events to contemporary situations).
Apply|Carry out or use a procedure in a given situation. EXECUTING: Carrying out; Applying a procedure to a familiar task (e.g., Divide one whole number by another whole number, both with multiple digits). IMPLEMENTING: Using; Applying a procedure to an unfamiliar task (e.g., Use Newton's Second Law in situations in which it is appropriate).
Analyze|Break material into its constituent parts and determine how the parts relate to-one another and to an overall structure or purpose. DIFFEAENTIATING: Discriminating, distinguishing, focusing, selecting; Distinguishing relevant from irrelevant parts or important from unimportant parts of presented material (e.g., Distinguish between relevant and irrelevant numbers in a mathematical word problem).  ORGANIZING: Finding coherence, integrating, outlining, parsing, structuring; Determining how elements fit or function within a structure (e.g. Structure evidence in a historical description into evidence for and against a particular historical explanation). ATTRIBUTING: Deconstructing; Determine a point of view, bias, values, or intent underlying presented material (e.g., Determine the point of view of the author of an essay in terms of his or her political perspective).
Evaluate|Make judgments based on criteria and standards. CHECKING: Coordinating, detecting, monitoring, testing; Detecting inconsistencies or fallacies within a process or product; determining whether a process or product has internal consistency; detecting the effectiveness of a procedure as it is being implemented (e.g., Determine if a scientist's conclusions follow from observed data). CRITIQUING: Judging; Detecting inconsistencies between a product and external criteria, determining whether a product has external consistency; detecting the appropriateness of a procedure for a given problem (e.g., Judge which of two methods is the best way to solve a given problem).
Create|Put elements together to form a coherent or functional whole; reorganize elements into a new pattern or structure. GENERATING: Hypothesizing; Coming up with alternative hypotheses based on criteria (e.g., Generate hypotheses to account for an observed phenomenon).  PLANNING: Designing; Devising a procedure for accomplishing some task (e.g., Plan a research paper on a given historical topic). PRODUCING: Constructing; Inventing a product (e.g., Build habitats for a specific purpose).
